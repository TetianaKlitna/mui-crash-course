about aria tags:
https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/

Use proper HTML tags for different elements:
<header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and others help with content organization.
Headings should be used in a hierarchical order, like <h1> for the main heading, <h2> for subheadings, and so on.
ARIA attributes provide additional accessibility information to screen readers.
ARIA roles: These define the role of an element (e.g., button, navigation).
ARIA landmarks: You can use roles like navigation, main, header, and footer to define sections of the page.
Example of aria-live to announce changes dynamically:
html
Копировать
<div aria-live="polite">
  <p>New message received!</p>
</div>
aria-live="polite" will announce this update to the user when it is less intrusive.

Keyboard navigation: Ensure your site is fully navigable with the keyboard.
<button tabindex="0">Submit</button>

Alt text: Provide alternative descriptions for images.
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" />
<img src="decorative-image.png" alt="" />

Color contrast: Make sure text is legible against backgrounds.

Give ability change colors and size of fonts 
You can also set your font size in relative units like em or rem instead of pixels to make resizing easier.

Responsive voice commands: Integrate voice control for users who can't use traditional input methods.
react-speech-recognition: React bindings for the Web Speech API for adding voice commands.

Screen reader support: Ensure dynamic content updates are announced.
react-aria-live: A React library for managing live regions for screen readers.

Form accessibility: Provide proper form labels, validation, and error handling.
Every form field has a properly associated <label>.
Use aria-describedby to provide additional hints or descriptions for form fields.
Forms need to be accessible for users with disabilities. Make sure that:
<form>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" aria-describedby="email-help" />
  <small id="email-help">We will never share your email.</small>
</form>


Testing: Use accessibility testing tools to check for issues.
Testing your site for accessibility is critical. You can use tools like:
Lighthouse (built into Chrome DevTools)
axe-core (a browser extension)
WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
React-axe (for React apps)

Tools and Libraries to Help You:
React A11y: A set of React components for building accessible UIs.
provides tools to manage focus, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and dynamic content updates, 
making it easier to build apps that are usable by people with disabilities.
